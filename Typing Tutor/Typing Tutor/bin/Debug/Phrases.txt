Aesop, a Greek author famous for his fables, is supposed to have lived from about 620 to 560 B.C. Aesop's fables are still taught as moral lessons and used as subjects for various entertainments, especially children's plays and cartoons. Aesop's fables are brief, succinct stories featuring animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature which are anthropomorphized (given human qualities), and illustrate moral lessons which may at the end be expressed explicitly in a pithy maxim (saying).
