It was autumn; the trees dropped their leaves, the earnest and severe pastor sat at the bedside of a dying person. A pious, faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor's wife...."If any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our Lord you shall certainly do so," said the pastor.  He folded her hands and read a psalm over the dead woman. She was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the earnest man, and in the parsonage it was empty and still, for its sun had set for ever.  She had gone home. It was night. A cold wind swept over the pastor's head; he opened his eyes, and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining into his room.  It was not so, however; there was a being standing before his bed, and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife.  She fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression, just as
if she wished to say something to him.  The pastor raised himself inbed and stretched his arms towards her, saying, "Not even you can find eternal rest!  You suffer, you best and most pious woman?"
